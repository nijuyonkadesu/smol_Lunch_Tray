# Small Lunch Tray
An application using MVVM pattern, using view models and best practices to separate data and ui layer

# Introduction
You're starting your average lunch time with an empty plate, but with this app, your wishes are granted. You're given the luxury to choose 3 dishes, and have them with your partner! You can also share your sense of taste to your friends and recommend them to try it out!!

This app demonstrates multiple fragments in an activity, a shared ViewModel across fragments,
data binding, LiveData, and the Jetpack Navigation component.
